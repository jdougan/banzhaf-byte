Notes on the test data
=======================

Votes-IT
---------
- Taken from original Byte article.
- Same thing in different formats to test parsing.
- Claimed to be from an Italian Parliament in 1983.

Votes CA
---------
- Dummy test data from a fictional Canadian House of Commons.

Votes ltext
------------
- Data taken from the examples in an online open licensed [CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) textbook, *Math in Society* by David Lippman.
- https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Applied_Mathematics/Math_in_Society_(Lippman)/03%3A_Weighted_Voting/3.04%3A_Calculating_Power-__Banzhaf_Power_Index
- The files that start with "Banz-ltest" are known correct output generated from the program from the corresponding "Votes-ltest". 
	- They should exactly match the corresponding testoutput.
- They are regenerated by `make regenerateLtextTestTargets`.
	- Be careful with that so you don't overwrite good data with bad.

US Electoral College 2024
--------------------------
- Columns
	- State Name
	- Electoral College Votes
	- Change in votes since last Presidential election in 2020.
- Pulled off of ballotpedia on 2024-04-16.
	- https://ballotpedia.org/Electoral_College_in_the_2024_presidential_election
- Much too large to exhaustively process, have to use Monte Carlo.
